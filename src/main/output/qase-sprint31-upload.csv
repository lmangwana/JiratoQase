IV-1804 Mobile App > Header UI Issues (Padding & Notification Counter Alignment),"QA FEEDBACK:
Application: Mobile App
ENVIRONMENTS: UAT - Android and iOS- 1.1.1 (47)

There are two UI issues affecting the header layout across different screens:

# Insufficient Padding at the Top of the Header (Text Cut-Off)

 The header text appears too close to the top, causing some letters (e.g., the “f” in _Stay Informed_) to be cut off.
 This is more noticeable on Android but also occurs on iOS.
 The text should have proper top padding for better readability.

# Misaligned Notification Counter (Bell Icon)

 The notification counter (red badge with unread count) is not properly positioned relative to the bell icon.
 It needs to be moved slightly up and to the right so that it appears tangential to the bell icon, as shown in the design reference.
 The current positioning makes it appear detached from the icon.

Expected Behavior:

 The header text should have sufficient padding at the top to prevent any letters from being cut off.
 The notification counter should be correctly positioned above and slightly to the right of the bell icon, aligning with the UI [design](https://www.figma.com/design/GsuPEHapwOlewdwuhlYUmN/VoteBud---Final-Ui-V2-Features?node-id=22828-134031&t=dC497D2dYXWUZLNz-4).

IV-1845 Mobile App > Delete Account > Delete Account flow issues – App hangs after deletion & iOS keyboard hides input field,"QA FEEDBACK:
Application: Mobile App
ENVIRONMENTS: UAT - Android and iOS- 1.1.1 (49)

# Delete Account Action Not Completing (Android & iOS):

After the user clicks the Delete Account button and confirms, the app shows a loader but does not log the user out or complete the account deletion process. The screen stays in a loading state, and no feedback is provided to confirm whether the deletion was successful or not.

# iOS UI Issue – Input Field Hidden by Keyboard:

On iOS devices, when the user tries to enter a reason under the “Tell us why” field, the on-screen keyboard pops up and obscures the input field. The user is unable to dismiss the keyboard easily, preventing them from returning back to the card view and completing the rest of the Delete Account flow.

Steps to Reproduce (Issue 1 – Delete Action Not Completing):

# Navigate to Profile > Delete Account.

# Enter a reason or select any reason.

# Tap on Delete Account and confirm.

# Observe that a loader appears, but the user remains on the card and is not logged out.

Steps to Reproduce (Issue 2 – iOS Input Field Hidden):

# Navigate to Profile > Delete Account on an iOS device.

# Tap on the “Tell us why” text field.

# Observe that the keyboard pops up and hides the input field.

# User cannot easily scroll to view what they’re typing or proceed further with the flow.

Expected Result:

 After tapping Delete Account, the user should be logged out and redirected to the login or welcome screen.

 On iOS, the input field should remain visible when the keyboard appears, or the screen should scroll accordingly to allow users to complete their input and proceed.

Actual Result:

 Delete Account button only triggers a loader with no user logout or feedback.

 On iOS, the keyboard obstructs the input field, breaking the flow and usability.

The goal of this feature is threefold.

# Reduce AI credit consumption.
# Make it easier for editors to explore bills in legislation interface.
# Automate issue assigning to bills.

The goals above will be accomplished by passing all bills through a 3-step process.

 AI Bill Filter - 3 Step Process
 Step 1
 Review bill for importance
 Assign Weighting
 IF low weighting, assign issue “Filtered”
 Step 2
 Bills that are not filtered
 Assign AI Generated Issue
 Assign Issues using AI
 Step 3
 Editors and Users can create AI summaries on demand
 Editors would have button in Airtable
 Users would create upon opening page for first time.
